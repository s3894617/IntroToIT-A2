      	<p>"I come from an English-speaking family of English & Australian ancestry. In my spare time, I enjoy computer gaming and gardening.
        I think my interest in IT was really piqued when cybersecurity started to become a
				more household term, due to an increased occurrence of cyber crime
				against both public and private organisations and an increasing number
				of large-scale cyber security events, such as the SolarWinds hack and
				the compromising of Microsoft Exchange email servers etc."</p>

	  <h3>Insights</h3>
	  <p>All team members personality testing results portray them as introverts- logically, communication is likely to be more difficult 
		  and it may be the case that participation in team meetings may be limited until team members are more comfortable with each other or the team dynamic itself. 
		  Due to the presence of introverted personalities it is likely that a team member will need to take on the responsibility of encouraging participation in 
		  team meetings as well as attempting to drive regular communication regarding work progress. Interestingly, 3 members of the team (Ishaan, Nima and Sam) all identify as "Logisticians"-
	  as a persoanlity type, Logisticians often tend to be more analytical thinkers and prefer to work alone- which may add further difficulty to team communication, if such traits prove to be accurate. </p>
